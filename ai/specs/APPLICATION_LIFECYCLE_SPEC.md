# Application Development Lifecycle Specification

This document specifies how the application development lifecycle should work for a new software repository.
It is **repo-agnostic**: it does not assume any particular file names, directory layout, language, build tool, branch model, or AI-agent guideline set.
A new repository should treat this spec as a normative description of *what* must exist and *how* the parts compose, then map it onto its own naming conventions during adoption.

The spec is organized around three layered models:

1. **Phases** — the coarse stages a piece of work passes through.
2. **Lenses** — the focused mental modes used inside each phase.
3. **Loops** — the iteration patterns that connect phases and lenses.

A repository is conformant with this spec when each phase has an identifiable owner artifact, each lens has an identifiable owner artifact or owner role, and each loop has a defined entry, exit, and cadence.

## 1. Definitions

- **Phase**: a coarse lifecycle stage with explicit entry and exit criteria. A piece of work is in exactly one phase at a time.
- **Lens**: a single focused activity an agent or human performs inside a phase. A lens has a question it answers, an owner artifact, and an exit condition.
- **Switch**: an explicit transition between two lenses or two phases. Every switch requires the prior working set to be dropped before the next one is loaded (`Context Hygiene`).
- **Trigger**: a signal that mandates a switch. Triggers are either *planned* (the next step in a loop) or *conditional* (e.g. a security-relevant change, a discovered plan gap, a failing validation).
- **Loop**: a sequence of lenses or phases that iterates until a defined exit condition is met. Loops may nest.
- **Artifact**: a durable file or record that is the source of truth for some behavior, decision, or rule. Artifacts are categorized as *spec*, *contract*, *plan*, *log*, or *guide*.
- **Owner**: the artifact (or, when no artifact applies, the role) that is authoritative for a given lens, phase, or rule. Each rule has exactly one owner.
- **Gate**: a checkpoint that must pass before a phase transition is allowed. Gates are mechanical (executable) where possible, and human-judged otherwise.

## 2. Phases

The lifecycle has eleven phases. Phases are ordered by typical progression, but conditional phases (`Replan`, `Hotfix`, `Rollback`) can fire from anywhere.

| # | Phase | Entry | Exit / Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Discovery | a request, idea, or signal arrives | scope and ambiguity surfaced; either rejected or promoted to Roadmap |
| 2 | Roadmap Intake | promoted Discovery item | item is sequenced and prioritized in active-work tracking |
| 3 | Planning | a roadmap item is picked up | a *decision-complete* plan exists and is approved |
| 4 | Implementation | an approved plan exists | smallest spec-driven change exists locally and self-validates |
| 5 | Testing | implementation is locally complete | required validation passes |
| 6 | Review | validated change exists | reviewer(s) approve; or change returns to Implementation/Testing |
| 7 | Integration | review is approved | change lands on the integration branch and post-merge checks pass |
| 8 | Release | integrated change is release-ready | versioned artifact is published and release notes exist |
| 9 | Deployment | released artifact exists | artifact runs in the target environment and verifies green |
| 10 | Operations | artifact is live | signals are observed; incidents are triaged or scheduled |
| 11 | Continuous Improvement | release closed or recurring signal observed | learnings captured; next-cycle Roadmap updated |

A `Closed` state exists for plans whose lifecycle is complete and archived; it is not a phase but a terminal status.

### 2.1 Phase Entry And Exit Rules

- A phase transition is **explicit**: the work item's status changes, and any owning artifact is updated in the same change.
- A phase **cannot be skipped** unless the spec change-class explicitly allows it (e.g. a documentation-only change skips Deployment).
- A phase **can be re-entered** when a downstream phase fails its gate (e.g. failed Review re-enters Implementation).
- A phase exit gate is either an **executable check** (build, tests, contract checks, smoke tests) or a **named approval** (reviewer sign-off, release manager gate).

## 3. Lenses

Lenses are grouped by the phase that owns them. A lens may appear in more than one phase when it represents the same activity at different cadences (e.g. `Sync` fires in Roadmap, Planning, and Continuous Improvement).

### 3.1 Discovery And Framing

- `Scan` — what artifacts and code already define this area?
- `Frame` — what is the actual change being requested? what is in and out of scope?
- `Clarify?` — does a material ambiguity require user input? *(conditional)*
- `Capture?` — does this surface a durable repo lesson worth recording? *(conditional)*

### 3.2 Roadmap And Requirements

- `Intake` — record the requested work in active-work tracking.
- `Refine` — restate the request as actionable behavior.
- `Prioritize` — does this belong in the current cycle?
- `Sequence` — what does this depend on or block?
- `Sync` — keep active-work tracking aligned with reality. *(cross-cutting)*

### 3.3 Design, Spec, And Planning

- `Design` — decide product or contract behavior.
- `Spec` — record the decided behavior in a governing executable or published spec artifact.
- `Decompose` — split into commit-sized milestone checkpoints; pick a workflow mode.
- `Validate-Plan` — run the plan readiness checklist before approval.
- `Replan?` — revise an approved plan when execution reality disagrees with it. *(cross-cutting)*

### 3.4 Implementation

- `Code` — write the smallest implementation that satisfies the spec.
- `Docs` — route documentation and contract updates per change-class.
- `Commit` — produce a milestone-shaped checkpoint with required tracking-artifact updates.
- `Handoff` — report status, blockers, and any required push or pull request.

### 3.5 Testing And Verification

- `Plan-Tests` — choose the smallest sufficient validation for this change-class.
- `Author-Tests` — write or update the executable spec or reproduction.
- `Run` — execute the chosen validation.
- `Diagnose?` — interpret a failure before changing anything. *(conditional)*
- `Fix?` — apply the smallest correction to implementation, test, or spec. *(conditional)*
- `Re-run` — confirm the previously failing validation now passes.
- `Record` — write the actual outcome into the plan's validation log.

### 3.6 Review

- `Self-Review` — first pass against the review priority list.
- `Code Review` — peer-style review of the validated diff.
- `Security Review?` — apply when security triggers fire. *(conditional)*
- `Docs Review?` — apply when the change is documentation-heavy. *(conditional)*
- `Decide` — approve or request changes; if changes, loop back.

### 3.7 Integration

- `Re-validate` — confirm the merge target still passes after rebase or conflict resolution.
- `Resolve-Conflicts?` — handle merge conflicts. *(conditional)*
- `Merge` — land the work on the integration branch.
- `Post-Merge-Verify` — confirm the integration branch still builds and matches the plan's intended state.

### 3.8 Release

- `Gate` — confirm release preconditions.
- `Tag` — produce the release artifact.
- `Notes` — generate or update release notes.
- `Publish` — execute the release.
- `Post-Release-Cleanup` — archive plans and refresh active-work tracking.

### 3.9 Deployment

- `Stage` — promote the artifact into a non-production environment.
- `Smoke` — run smoke or external-verification checks.
- `Promote` — promote to the next environment.
- `Verify` — confirm deployed behavior in the target environment.
- `Rollback?` — back out a failed deployment. *(conditional)*

### 3.10 Operations

- `Observe` — read production signals (metrics, logs, traces, user reports).
- `Triage` — classify an incident or defect.
- `Hotfix?` — produce a minimal fix outside the normal plan flow. *(conditional)*
- `Patch?` — produce a normal-flow corrective change. *(conditional)*
- `Backport?` — apply a fix to an older supported line. *(conditional)*
- `Deprecate?` — schedule removal of a behavior. *(conditional)*

### 3.11 Continuous Improvement

- `Retrospect` — review what worked and what did not after a release or major plan.
- `Capture-Learning` — record a durable repo-wide lesson.
- `Refactor?` — schedule structural improvement work as its own plan. *(conditional)*
- `Tech-Debt-Plan?` — convert recurring pain into a planned roadmap item. *(conditional)*
- `Sync` — feed outcomes back into active-work tracking.

## 4. Phase-To-Lens Map

Each phase has an in-order primary lens sequence. `?` marks conditional lenses.

| Phase | In-order lenses |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery | `Scan` → `Frame` → `Clarify?` → `Capture?` |
| Roadmap Intake | `Intake` → `Refine` → `Prioritize` → `Sequence` → `Sync` |
| Planning | `Frame` → `Design` → `Spec` → `Decompose` → `Validate-Plan` → `Sync` → `Replan?` |
| Implementation | `Spec` → `Code` → `Docs` → `Run` → `Replan?` → `Self-Review` → `Code Review` → `Security Review?` → `Commit` → `Handoff` |
| Testing | `Plan-Tests` → `Author-Tests` → `Run` → `Diagnose?` → `Fix?` → `Re-run` → `Record` |
| Review | `Self-Review` → `Code Review` → `Security Review?` → `Docs Review?` → `Decide` |
| Integration | `Re-validate` → `Resolve-Conflicts?` → `Merge` → `Post-Merge-Verify` |
| Release | `Gate` → `Tag` → `Notes` → `Publish` → `Post-Release-Cleanup` |
| Deployment | `Stage` → `Smoke` → `Promote` → `Verify` → `Rollback?` |
| Operations | `Observe` → `Triage` → `Hotfix?` → `Patch?` → `Backport?` → `Deprecate?` |
| Continuous Improvement | `Retrospect` → `Capture-Learning` → `Refactor?` → `Tech-Debt-Plan?` → `Sync` |

The `Implementation` row deliberately interleaves review and validation lenses because the milestone execution loop runs them in tight succession; this is descriptive, not a license to skip the dedicated `Testing` and `Review` phases for the overall change.

## 5. Loops

The lifecycle contains six loops. They nest as follows:

```
Outer Product Loop                              [per release]
  ├── Operate-and-Improve Loop                  [continuous, post-release]
  └── Plan Loop                                 [per plan]
        └── Milestone Execution Loop            [per milestone]
              ├── Red-Green Loop                [per failing validation]
              └── Review Loop                   [per diff before merge]
```

### 5.1 Outer Product Loop

- Lenses: `Sync` (roadmap) → planning → implementation → release → `Retrospect` → `Capture-Learning` → `Sync`.
- Cadence: per release.
- Exit: a release ships and its outcomes feed the next intake.

### 5.2 Plan Loop

- Lenses: `Frame` → `Design` → `Spec` → `Decompose` → `Validate-Plan` → `Replan?` → `Validate-Plan`.
- Cadence: per plan, until the plan is decision-complete.
- Exit: plan is approved and ready for execution.

### 5.3 Milestone Execution Loop

- Lenses: `Spec` → `Code` → `Docs` → `Run` → `Replan?` → `Self-Review` → `Code Review` → `Security Review?` → `Commit` → `Handoff`.
- Cadence: per milestone within an approved plan.
- Exit: milestone commit lands and tracking artifacts are updated.

### 5.4 Red-Green Loop

- Lenses: `Run` → `Diagnose` → `Fix` → `Re-run`.
- Cadence: per failing validation, inside a milestone.
- Exit: previously failing validation passes; if it cannot pass, exit through `Replan?`.

### 5.5 Review Loop

- Lenses: `Self-Review` → `Code Review` → `Security Review?` → `Docs Review?` → `Decide` → loop back to `Code` or `Run` if changes requested.
- Cadence: per diff before merge.
- Exit: an `Approve` decision; otherwise re-enter the milestone loop.

### 5.6 Operate-and-Improve Loop

- Lenses: `Observe` → `Triage` → (`Hotfix?` or `Patch?`) → `Capture-Learning` → `Sync`.
- Cadence: continuous, post-release.
- Exit: the signal is resolved or scheduled as planned work.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Triggers

Triggers can fire from any phase and force a switch.

- `Replan` — execution-time gap, contradicted locked decision, scope drift, or design decision discovered mid-execution.
- `Security Review` — change touches authentication, authorization, secrets, sensitive data, deployment-facing config, CI permissions, or release/publish paths.
- `Sync` — any change that affects active-work tracking or contract artifacts.
- `Capture-Learning` — a recurring repo-wide lesson surfaces.
- `Docs-Routing` — a change touches a contract or maintainer-facing document.
- `Context-Hygiene` — fires between any two lenses; the prior lens's working set must be dropped before the next is loaded.
- `Rollback` — deployed behavior fails verification.
- `Hotfix` — a production incident requires a fix outside the normal plan flow.

## 7. Required Artifact Set

A conformant repository must provide artifacts that own the following responsibilities. Names below are *roles*, not file names; map each role to one or more files in the target repo.

| Role | Owns | Typical realization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Charter | mission, supported scope, public contract summary | a top-level project overview |
| Setup Guide | local environment, tooling, onboarding, troubleshooting | a setup or environment doc |
| Roadmap | active-work tracking, sequencing, current-cycle state | a roadmap doc |
| Release History | shipped changes per version | a changelog |
| Plan | per-task decision-complete handoff document | a plan file per active task |
| Executable Spec | behavior verified by automation | tests, contract checks, benchmarks |
| Published Contract | human-facing API/contract docs | reference docs, OpenAPI/JSON schema, example requests |
| Engineering Rules | spec-driven rules, lifecycle, branch and worktree policy, definition of done | an engineering rules doc |
| Phase Owner Guides | one guide per phase or owning lens group | per-phase guides (planning, execution, testing, review, release, etc.) |
| Learnings | durable engineering lessons that survive refactors | a learnings doc |
| Architecture Snapshot | current codebase map and structural guidance | an architecture doc |

A repository that lacks any of these has a *gap*; the gap should be recorded in active-work tracking with an owner.

## 8. Spec-Driven Development Rule

Behavior changes must be made spec-first:

1. Identify the behavior being changed.
2. Identify the spec artifact that defines that behavior.
3. Update or add the spec **first**.
4. Implement the smallest code change that satisfies the updated spec.
5. Verify the executable and published specs remain aligned.

If the intended behavior is not clear enough to express as a spec, the work returns to `Planning` and stays there until it is.

### 8.1 Truth Priority

When sources of truth disagree, resolve in this order:

1. explicit user request in the current task
2. executable specs (tests, contract checks, compatibility checks, benchmark gates)
3. published contract documents
4. current-cycle state in the roadmap
5. active planning entries
6. release history
7. AI- or human-facing guidance documents

## 9. Definition Of Done

A change is complete when **all** of the following hold:

- the intended behavior exists in an appropriate spec artifact
- implementation and specs agree
- public contract artifacts are updated when behavior changed
- required validation has passed and the result is recorded against the plan
- the change has landed on the integration branch (or, when run from a side branch, has been pushed and either merged or proposed via pull request)
- the active-work tracking entry reflects the post-change state
- if released, the release artifact is published and notes are written

## 10. Branch And Worktree Invariants

- Treat the integration branch as the only source of truth for *completed* work.
- Keep side-branch or worktree implementation isolated until the planned scope is complete and locally validated.
- Prefer merging accepted branches or pull requests; use cherry-pick only when the user asks for it, when accepting less than the full branch, or when a normal merge is not viable, and record the reason.
- Do not cut releases from unintegrated side branches, worktrees, detached tips, or changes that have not landed on the integration branch.

## 11. Roles

Roles can be filled by humans, AI agents, or both. A single person may hold multiple roles.

- **Requester** — provides the task or signal that enters Discovery.
- **Planner** — owns the Plan Loop and produces a decision-complete plan.
- **Implementer** — executes the Milestone Execution Loop.
- **Tester** — owns the Red-Green Loop and validates the change.
- **Reviewer** — owns the Review Loop and decides Approve / Request-Changes.
- **Integrator** — lands the change on the integration branch.
- **Releaser** — runs the Release phase.
- **Operator** — runs Deployment and Operations.
- **Curator** — runs Continuous Improvement; captures learnings; updates active-work tracking.

## 12. Adoption Guide

To adopt this spec in a new repository:

1. **Create the artifact set** named in §7, using whatever file names fit the repo's conventions.
2. **Map each lens to an owner artifact.** Every lens in §3 needs exactly one owner. Where a single artifact is too small, split it; where two artifacts overlap, merge.
3. **Pick the workflow modes** the repo will support (e.g. linear, single-plan parallel, multi-plan parallel) and document them in the engineering-rules artifact.
4. **Adopt lens labels incrementally.** Tag existing prose in owner artifacts with bracketed lens names (e.g. `[Code]`, `[Run]`, `[Replan?]`) rather than rewriting the prose.
5. **Define the change-class table.** For each change-class (public behavior, internal refactor, docs-only, setup, release-history), state which artifacts must move together. This is the routing table the `Docs` lens consumes.
6. **Define the validation table.** For each change-class, state the smallest sufficient validation. This is the table the `Plan-Tests` and `Run` lenses consume.
7. **Define the gates.** For each phase exit, state whether the gate is executable or named-approval.
8. **Wire up cross-cutting triggers.** Each trigger in §6 must point to the artifact that owns it.
9. **Record gaps.** Anything in the spec that the repo does not (yet) cover becomes a roadmap item with an owner.

## 13. Conformance Levels

A repository declares its conformance level explicitly.

- **L1 — Spec-Driven Core**: §7 artifacts exist, §8 spec-first rule is enforced, §9 definition of done is enforced. Phases 1–7 are owned. This is the minimum.
- **L2 — Released**: L1 plus phases 8 (Release) and 11 (Continuous Improvement).
- **L3 — Operated**: L2 plus phases 9 (Deployment) and 10 (Operations).
- **L4 — Lens-Annotated**: any of the above, plus owner artifacts that have adopted lens labels (§12 step 4) and explicit cross-cutting trigger wiring (§12 step 8).

Conformance level is recorded in the engineering-rules artifact and reviewed at each release.

## 14. Non-Goals

- This spec does **not** mandate a specific branching model (trunk-based, GitFlow, release branches).
- This spec does **not** mandate a specific issue tracker, CI system, or hosting platform.
- This spec does **not** mandate file names or directory layout.
- This spec does **not** define agile/waterfall ceremonies; it defines lifecycle structure.
- This spec does **not** prescribe team size, sprint length, or release cadence.
- This spec does **not** replace product, security, or compliance policies; it gives them owner slots.

## 15. Glossary Of Common Mappings

When mapping the spec onto common stacks, the following are typical (not normative):

- *Executable Spec* → unit tests, integration tests, contract tests, snapshot tests, benchmark gates.
- *Published Contract* → OpenAPI/JSON Schema, gRPC `.proto`, GraphQL schema, public README, reference docs.
- *Roadmap* → a `ROADMAP.md`, a project-board column, or an issue tracker label.
- *Release History* → `CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub Releases, package registry release notes.
- *Phase Owner Guide* → contributor guides, runbooks, or AI-agent guideline files.
- *Active-Work Tracking* → roadmap doc, project board, milestone, or kanban column.

## 16. Versioning Of This Spec

- This spec is itself versioned. Breaking changes increment the major version; additive lens or phase entries increment the minor version; clarifications increment the patch version.
- A repository pins the spec version it conforms to in its engineering-rules artifact.
- Renames of lenses or phases are breaking changes and must be recorded with the rename map for downstream repos to follow.
